  abstract={본 논문에서는 게임 내 거래 네트워크를 분석하는 방법론으로 community ecology 분야에서 ranking system 측정을 위해 사용되는 알고리즘인 David’s score를 활용하였다. 이를 게임 데이터에 맞추어 변형한 selective David’s score를 개발하였으며, 실제 MMORPG 거래소 데이터에 적용하였다. 아이템별 평균가 대비 거래 가격 구간을 나누어 적용해 목표하는 이상 거래를 효과적으로 탐지했으며, label이 존재하지 않기 때문에 해당 게임의 행동 로그 및 상태 정보를 이용하여 패턴 확인 및 검증까지 진행하였다.},

  title={A Comprehensive Evaluation of the Process of Copying a Complex Figure in Early- and Late-Onset Alzheimer Disease: A Quantitative Analysis of Digital Pen Data},
  author={Kim†, Ko Woon and Lee†, Sung Yun and Choi, Jongdoo and Chin, Juhee and Lee, Byung Hwa and Na*, Duk L. and Choi*, Jee Hyun},
  abstract={Background: The Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test (RCFT) is a neuropsychological test that is widely used to assess visual memory and visuoconstructional deficits in patients with cognitive impairment, including Alzheimer disease (AD). Patients with AD have an increased tendency for exhibiting extraordinary behaviors in the RCFT for selecting the drawing area, organizing the figure, and deciding the order of images, among other activities. However, the conventional scoring system based on pen and paper has a limited ability to reflect these detailed behaviors. Objective: This study aims to establish a scoring system that addresses not only the spatial arrangement of the finished drawing but also the drawing process of patients with AD by using digital pen data. Methods: A digital pen and tablet were used to copy complex figures. The stroke patterns and kinetics of normal controls (NCs) and patients with early-onset AD (EOAD) and late-onset AD (LOAD) were analyzed by comparing the pen tip trajectory, spatial arrangement, and similarity of the finished drawings. Results: Patients with AD copied the figure in a more fragmented way with a longer pause than NCs (EOAD: P=.045; LOAD: P=.01). Patients with AD showed an increased tendency to draw the figures closer toward the target image in comparison with the NCs (EOAD: P=.005; LOAD: P=.01) Patients with AD showed the lower accuracy than NCs (EOAD: P=.004; LOAD: P=.002). Patients with EOAD and LOAD showed similar but slightly different drawing behaviors, especially in space use and in the initial stage of drawing. Conclusions: The digitalized complex figure test evaluated copying performance quantitatively and further elucidated the patients’ ongoing process during copying. We believe that this novel approach can be used as a digital biomarker of AD. In addition, the repeatability of the test will delineate the process of executive functions and constructional organization abilities with disease progression.},

  abstract={The structures as building blocks for designing functional nanomaterials have fueled the development of versatile nanoprobes to understand local structures of noncrystalline specimens. Progress in analyzing structures of individual specimens with atomic scale accuracy has been notable recently. In most cases, however, only a limited number of specimens are inspected lacking statistics to represent the systems with structural inhomogeneity. Here, by employing single-particle imaging with X-ray free electron lasers and algorithms for multiple-model 3D imaging, we succeeded in investigating several thousand specimens in a couple of hours and identified intrinsic heterogeneities with 3D structures. Quantitative analysis has unveiled 3D morphology, facet indices, and elastic strain. The 3D elastic energy distribution is further corroborated by molecular dynamics simulations to gain mechanical insight at the atomic level. This work establishes a route to high-throughput characterization of individual specimens in large ensembles, hence overcoming statistical deficiency while providing quantitative information at the nanoscale.},

  author={Lee, Sung Yun and Cho, Do Hyung and Jung, Chulho and Sung, Daeho and Nam, Daewoong and Kim, Sangsoo and Song, Changyong},
  abstract={Phase recovery is a well-known inverse problem prevalent across science disciplines and attracts active research interests to develop a number of theoretical and experimental methods. Recent developments in artificial intelligence have further prompted research activities in processing the experimentally collected imperfect data, but applications have been limited to slow-varying data such as real images. Experimental noise present in largely fluctuating diffraction data, in particular, adds practical challenges to hamper consistent phase recovery. Here, we introduce a convolutional neural-network assisted $k$-space denoising method that can directly manage noisy diffraction signals. It showed superior performance on denoising the diffraction data, which promote improved phase recovery from noise-buried single-pulse diffraction signals obtained by the x-ray free-electron laser. Adapting our method to general diffraction data can expand boundaries of interpretable data and enhance observability of faint objects with weak signals.},

  title={Nanoscale Three-Dimensional Network Structure of a Mesoporous Particle Unveiled via Adaptive Multidistance Coherent X-ray Tomography},
  author={Lee†, Sung Yun and Cho†, Do Hyung and Song†, Sung Chan and Shin, Jaeyong and Hwang, Junha and Park, Eunyoung and Lee, Su Yong and Kim, Seongseop and Lee, Jinwoo and Song*, Changyong},
  abstract={Mesoporous nanoparticles provide rich platforms to devise functional materials by customizing the three-dimensional (3D) structures of nanopores. With the pore network as a key tuning parameter, the noninvasive and quantitative characterization of these 3D structures is crucial for the rational design of functional materials. This has prompted researchers to develop versatile nanoprobes with a high penetration power to inspect various specimens sized a few micrometers at nanoscale 3D resolutions. Here, with adaptive phase retrievals on independent data sets with different sampling frequencies, we introduce multidistance coherent X-ray tomography as a noninvasive and quantitative nanoprobe to realize high-resolution 3D imaging of micrometer-sized specimens. The 3D density distribution of an entire mesoporous silica nanoparticle was obtained at 13 nm 3D resolution for quantitative physical and morphological analyses of its 3D pore structure. The morphological features of the whole 3D pore network and pore connectivity were examined to gain insight into the potential functions of the particles. The proposed multidistance tomographic imaging scheme with quantitative structural analyses is expected to advance studies of functional materials by facilitating their structure-based rational design.},
